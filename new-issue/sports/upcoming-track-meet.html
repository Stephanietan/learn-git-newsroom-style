    <h1>Upcoming Track Meet</h1>
    <p>Roosevelt High School is hosting an open amateur track meet. Anyone is welcome
    to join. Participate in our joggers mile. Everyone writes down their time at
    the beginning, no one is allowed to wear a watch during the race and the person
    who finishes closest to their estimated time takes home a pie!</p>
